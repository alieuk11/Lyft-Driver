# Lyft-Driver
This program determines the shortest route for a lyft driver given that each driver is restricted to a specified range. Developed an error detection and correction algorithm in order to clean up the corrupt data for usage. We then output a file containing the most optimal, energy efficient route that the lyft driver must take in order to stay within their limited range.
